# IMPLEMENTATION.md

## Project Goal
Containerize HDHomeRunEPG-to-XmlTv for Unraid Community Apps with HTTP-served EPG data, eliminating volume mounting requirements.

## Sprint 1: Core Containerization ✅
**Goal**: Basic Docker container with EPG generation
- Downloaded GPL-licensed HDHomeRunEPG_To_XmlTv.py script
- Created Dockerfile with Python 3.11-slim base
- Implemented cron scheduling via supervisor
- Added environment variable configuration

## Sprint 2: HTTP Server Implementation ✅
**Goal**: Serve EPG via HTTP instead of file mounting
- Developed epg_server.py with multiple endpoints
- Added support for HEAD requests (Plex requirement)
- Implemented proper XML headers and content types
- Created professional web interface at root endpoint

## Sprint 3: Dummy Programming Feature ✅
**Goal**: Support channels without EPG data
- Added URL parameter support (?dummy=30min, ?dummy=1hr, etc.)
- Fetches HDHomeRun lineup for missing channels
- Generates configurable duration blocks
- Combines with format parameters (?format=raw&dummy=2hr)

## Sprint 4: Unraid Integration (Current)
**Goal**: Prepare for Community Apps submission
- [ ] Complete media server testing (Plex ✅, Jellyfin pending, Emby pending)
- [ ] Verify overnight cron updates
- [ ] Monitor resource usage
- [ ] Submit to Unraid Community Apps

## Future Enhancements (Post-Release)
- **Performance**: Consider caching EPG data in memory
- **Features**: M3U playlist generation for IPTV apps
- **Integration**: Direct HDHomeRun tuner control
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics endpoint
- **UI**: Admin panel for configuration changes

## Technical Decisions
1. **Python over Shell**: Better error handling and XML processing
2. **HTTP Server**: Eliminates volume mounting complexity
3. **URL Parameters**: More flexible than container-wide settings
4. **Supervisor**: Reliable process management for cron and server
5. **No Database**: Keep it simple, file-based storage

## Success Criteria
- ✅ EPG accessible via HTTP without volume mounts
- ✅ Automatic updates via cron
- ✅ Plex compatibility verified
- ⏳ Jellyfin/Emby compatibility
- ⏳ Unraid Community Apps acceptance
- ⏳ User documentation complete
